I bumped into an insidious and powerful force again this week. Something that flexes its muscle behind the scenes. That sneaky little SOB, cognitive dissonance.

My habits brought this to the forefront this week. I know exactly how important habits are. They create a positive flywheel effect and when it's spinning I feel good! I'm healthier, think clearer, create more, and even my consumption habits become more mindful and enjoyable (think enjoyable discovery on social media versus doom scrolling). 

I want that.

However, this positive flywheel has too many damned easy off-ramps. One slip leads to another, leads to another, and then I'm zipping around on a negative flywheel. The real bitch of it is that can happen without me really being conscious of it.

At this stage of my life, I've got the freedom to choose how I spend my time. It’s like living in a massively open-world game. But that freedom can be a double-edged sword. A weekend trip disrupts routine. Then I don't eat any regular meals on Monday. A late night working leads to tiredness on Tuesday. Tiredness invites snacking and sweets. Cognition nosedives. Suddenly, without any deliberate decision, I've leaped off that positive flywheel entirely and instead I'm riding a plane that's plummeting towards the earth.

I understand these Dark Arts on an intellectual level. I have tactics and practice with defense against them, but they're not called the Dark Arts for no reason. They know how to short-circuit those defenses.

Ok, so those are the habits, but the title of this post is cognitive dissonance. Here is where that comes into play.

It hit me while thinking about a friend's toddler, who is grumpy during routine things they do every day. I've taught preschoolers and kindergartners. I know that young children rely on adults to be their prefrontal cortex. Routines and habits are essential. Stick to them, and daily activities like meals and bedtime are manageable. Deviate and you're setting yourself up for tantrums. Structure helps keep kids regulated.

I don't offer unsolicited advice because it's rarely acted upon and sometimes completely unwelcome. But as I watch my friends struggle, I can clearly see how implementing some simple regularity could alleviate a lot of stress for them.

Mind you, at the same time I'm observing how a little more regularity would go a long way in making things easier for this family, my adult brain is not only failing to provide the structure I know I need, it's got me thinking that I am cruising along just fine. The warning lights are flashing on the dashboard of my car yet I don't even notice them two feet from my face.

Richard Feynman famously [stated at a Caltech commencement that][feynman-fool], "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool."

I've built part of my career on my ability to observe how executives and organizations fool themselves. And yet, when it comes to looking in the mirror, I can still pull the wool over my own eyes.

The remedy is simple.

Reflection.

There are plenty of tools and tactics to reflect: walks, voice memos, Morning Pages, friends, coaches, therapists or even talking to an LLM.

The key thing to remember though is that if fooling ourselves is a first principle of human nature, then reflection, is a first principle of seeing reality.
