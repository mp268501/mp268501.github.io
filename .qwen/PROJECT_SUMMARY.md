# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Configure a Jekyll-based static website to properly handle the AGENTS.md file so it doesn't appear in site navigation, keeping it as a behind-the-scenes documentation file.

## Key Knowledge
- This is a Jekyll-based static website project using the minima theme (version 2.5.2)
- The project contains blog posts in `_posts/`, static files, and configuration in `_config.yml`
- By default, Jekyll processes markdown files in the root directory and may include them in navigation if they have front matter
- The site has build commands: `bundle install` for dependencies and `bundle exec jekyll build` for building
- Files can be excluded from Jekyll processing using the `exclude` list in `_config.yml`
- AGENTS.md is a documentation file containing setup commands and PR checklist that should remain hidden from website visitors

## Recent Actions
- Identified that AGENTS.md was appearing in navigation because it lacked proper YAML front matter and wasn't excluded from processing
- Successfully added AGENTS.md to the exclude list in `_config.yml` to prevent Jekyll from processing it
- Rebuilt the site to confirm that AGENTS.md is no longer included in the output
- Confirmed that only the blog post about AI agents (`not-moores-law-for-ai-agents.html`) remains in the `_site` directory, while AGENTS.md is no longer being processed

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Identify why AGENTS.md was showing up in navigation
2. [DONE] Understand that user wants to exclude AGENTS.md from navigation completely
3. [DONE] Add AGENTS.md to exclude list in _config.yml
4. [DONE] Verify that AGENTS.md is no longer processed by Jekyll after rebuild
