Did Zuck hire the right talent?

There seems to be an idea that Meta was talent-poor. Specifically in the generative AI space, and if we drill down more, specifically in the turning generative AI into a product space.

I'm going to speculate.


Management - what it is, what it does. In the abstract. In the concrete.

My experience.

The system determines performance. That's very general.

People can respond in a system, kinda like an old Ninentdo game, where you get a menu of options.

List the ways people can respond.

In BigCo's, most people cannot materially change the system. Maybe they can drive a local maxima in their realm, but they're constrained by broader systemic forces.
Seeing this the first time with DCX in Mexico.

This is what Founder Mode is all about. A founder has the mandate of heaven to change the system. 


It's geniuses, but not just geniuses. The book about Innovators.

Manufacturing and innovation. Execs can cook up whatever, but it takes process, operators, quality, design to start with and they have to know how to work together.


That's all abstract. I've got experience backing this up and it's bolstered by theory, and history. Human nature. How people work together, or don't.

That's the lens I'm looking at this generative AI race through.

The least clear is the Chinese companies like Deepseek, Moonshot, Alibaba, Tencent. Technical details are shared, but I don't know much about those orgs. However, they ship.


Big Co's can't ship. It's why I wonder what happened at Google that allowed them to ship. 

When I look at Meta, I see a company with one of the most anti-innovatiion processes man has invented--stack ranking, alive and well in their company, which crushes collaboration, increases fear, and it anti-innovation to its core. 

Imagine John Pearce having to stack rank his team at Bell Labs. No, I'm not helping Claude Shannon anymore because I have to save my own skin.

As OpenAI has talent depart and brings in new talent, it will be about the system, that management puts in place that enables them to continue to innovate or not. 
OpenAI has expanded into more things than I can keep track of. Entropy can be ignored, but unlike a social construct, it won't go away.


Examples from the TV show Silicon Valley how management fucked over a team.
- whether at Hooli or the conjoined triangles





Itâ€™s funny that people on this site think major LLM efforts are talent-bound rather than org-bound.

The talent differential has never been big between major orgs. Most of the difference in outcomes is due to organisational factors - like allocating compute to the right bets, and letting good research and engineering triumph over destructive politics.

This makes for a less sexy story though. People prefer to believe that breakthroughs are made by lone geniuses - instead of the cumulative effort of many nameless, social media averse people â€” supported by an org that allows the best ideas to win and manages big egos. 

If you donâ€™t believe me - then consider how some researchers suddenly gain or lose impact and productivity when they switch orgs. Was it because they gained or lost IQ points? ðŸ™‚

(Sorry, this is super obvious to anyone whoâ€™s actually worked in these labs - but you wouldnâ€™t believe it based on the X feed right now!)
