            Making the Impossible Possible
        </h3>
        <h2 class="gradient-text inline-block feynman-quote">"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself‚Äîand you are the easiest person to fool." - Richard Feynman</h2>

        <p class="intro-text">Before I ever knew who Richard Feynman was, I understood this principle. A consulting project for Daimler Chrysler was a formative early work experience. I had a front row seat to see how a global company was fooling itself. The company had a legitimate strategy, but it was never going to execute it because Jurgen Schrempp and DCX's executives were living in a separate reality from the rest of the organization. I had a unique opportunity to interview people across the organization. The interviews painted a portrait of a dysfunctional company. My report mirrored reality back to Daimler but it didn't have an impact. A few years later, DCX imploded. I saw reality and it predicted the future.</p>
        I learned three things from my Daimler experience:
        1. Interview to understand
        2. Fooling themselves (it's pervasive, not always intentional, but its human nature)
        3. 
            
            
            Early work experiences as a kid--managers were wildly disconnected. Were they fooling themselves? I wasn't sure.  </p>

        <p class="intro-text">As a founder, a teacher, a consultant, a coach, or an employee. A 20 year track record proving it. No pedigree. No tailwinds. Outsized results.</p>
        <p class="intro-text">How?</p>

                <p>Eighty percent of people I work with come around.  Twenty percent prefer to continue to fool themselves.</p>

                <p>Develop you and an org that amplifies your strengths and makes your weaknesses irrelevant.</p>
                <p>Durable problem solving, that's generative.</p>
