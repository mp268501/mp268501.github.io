What happened with OpenAI's offer to buy Windsurf?

A lot of details have shaken from the tree, but this is the one question I haven't seen addressed.

I realized that I like history because it helps me understand human nature. Human nature doesn't change. It's why the saying "history may not repeat, but it rhymes" is true. I kind of obsess over ["knowing the game you're playing"][game-of-life] and having a fleshed out understanding of human nature is the cheat code.

With Windsurf, I don't understand the game.

Some facts: OpenAI extended a $3 billion offer to purchase Windsurf. The stated sticking point was sharing Windsurf IP with Microsoft. I'm in none of these rooms so I'm relying on reporting. Bloomberg called out Windsurf as the party that didn't want Microsoft to have access to its IP. Ostensibly that's Varun and maybe Douglas Chen in the driver's seat.

> OpenAI thought it had an agreement with Windsurf and almost announced the acquisition in early May, according to people familiar with the deal. There had been a signed letter of intent, and Windsurf investors were given what’s known as waterfall agreements, notifying each party how much money they were expected to make, the people said.

It seems like this arrangement would have seen Varun, Douglas Chen, and the entirety of the Windsurf team go to OpenAI. 

Instead, Varun and Chen took only a team of researchers to Deepmind at a $600 million discount. That sticking point about sharing IP with Microsoft? Apparently not an issue anymore as big G received a non-exclusive license to use Windsurf's IP.

Something doesn't add up for me here. Founders and VCs leaving $600 million on the table while creating a confusing deal that paints the founder in a bad light?

As the smoke clears, I'll be curious to see if it really was Varun that demanded the no IP to Microsoft clause or if something else tanked the OAI deal.
