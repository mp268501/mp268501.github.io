There is an astounding lack of rigor in the AI discussions I hear.

I'm an outsider so I pick and choose who to listen to and try to understand how they think, what they think, and why they think that.

I'm going to generalize and possibly strawman here. SV/startup/tech world is all about thinking from first principles.

When I hear them talk about AI, they are looking at only what is right in front of their face and not even seeing that clearly.
