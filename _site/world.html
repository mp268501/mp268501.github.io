I want to live in a high trust society. One with opportunity.
So if you are someone selling a band-aid for a low-trust society that just extracts rent, then I don’t like you. 
If you are selling yourself as “changing the world” or making the world safer at the same time. 
Then I really don’t like your grifting ass. 
Chalkschool or whatever they are called now. Flock Safety. All that bullshit.
They are taking money out of taxpayers pockets to perpetuate a bad system.
Billionaires. They’re insulated from society. Full time bodyguards and armed protective services, etc. 
They don’t know what it’s like.
This is the first time in my life I’ve ever seen normal people afraid to honk at another car that is say sitting at an intersection with a green light because they aren’t paying attention for fear of escalating into a deadly situation instead of the driver simply throwing up a ‘sorry’ wave and getting going through the light. 
Societal decay is a slowly boiling pot. People who aren’t fully aware it’s happening are one thing. 
People who are, but are just choosing to profit off it, consequences be damned, and then insulate themselves from the consequences—well those people are my enemies.


Hard to see that with the current regime in power in the United States. Bad faith, lawless, and grift. Hard to see them doing anything to think through and prepare for the future for the betterment of all instead of focusing on his triad of: Trump is loyalty, money, brand. 


I’ve heard compounding referred to as the 8th wonder of the world, my friends, cognitive dissonance may be even more powerful. 

It incorporates compounding, yet can have pernicious effects on individuals, societies, and as we are seeing, civilization as a whole. Humans, we are amazing, bent steel to our will, tamed the earth, and yet we are stuck with outdated an outdated operating system and wetware from an age where our threats, opportunities, and lives looked nothing like today.

Fooling myself. Fooling ourselves.

Utopia doesn’t exist because of this. 


Reflection isn’t important (Bill Gates).
We don’t look back.


The opportunities are so huge (and current issues in school so big) that it seems imperative that we, as a society, figure out how to best use AI in education as soon as we possibly can.

Yes, and whoever can build the school network that can rapidly scale student seats + has the academic dataset to deploy tutors network-wide has a chance to bend the arc of US history.



this is what non edtech founders think the contrarian insight is; though most education founders I know are aware of 2-sigma 

the issue has always been motivation (internal or external - via teachers/parents' guidance) 

AI solves tooling => so the precocious ones learn much faster (where previously they'd labour through Google searches with 10x the efforts to grok a learning concept) but changes very little for the median / below-median student who lacks motivation to progress. 

AI also takes friction away from cheating on homework & tests -> results in a leftward shift not rightward shift of the curve though now with a fatter right tail
